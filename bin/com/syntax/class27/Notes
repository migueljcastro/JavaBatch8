Main OOPS concept in java:
1)Inheritance
2)Polymorphism
3)Abstraction
4)Encapsulation
Inheritance:
Is a mechanism to refer functions and fields of parent class to subclasses
It is a process where one class acquires the properties and methods of another class.
Polymorphism:
The ability of the object to take many forms
Being able to do multiple functions using same reference variables but with different objects
process when objects can preform actions in a different way
There are two types of Polymorphism runtime/dynamic late binding and compile time early binding or static
We can achieve compile time polymorphism using method overloading
we can achieve dynamic or runtime binding using method overriding
Abstraction:
Is a process of showing the functionality to the user but hiding the process or implementation details behind it
To implement Abstraction we use the keyword abstract.

If we have declared a class as abstract we cannot create objects of that class
Key Points:
Abstract class:
1) Can have Abstract and non abstract method
2) Can have constructor
3) Can have instance and static members
4) Can have static and final methods and fields
5) Abstract methods can't have static modifier and can not be private and we can not make them final

We can not create objects of Abstract class.
