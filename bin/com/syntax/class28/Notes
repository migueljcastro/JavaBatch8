Abstraction:
Is a process of showing the functionality to the user and hiding the implementation details.
we can achieve the abstraction in java in two ways
1) Abstract classes and other one is Interfaces
Abstract classes can have abstract methods we can implement those abstract methods in our child classes.

Rules to follow:
1)We can have as many abstract methods in a class as we want...no limit in abstract methods in classes
2) We can't have abstract methods as private because they will never be inherited and we will not be able to provide
implementation.
3)We can"t declare our abstract method as final bc final methods can never be overriddenMy

abstract class ParentClass{

public abstract method1();
}

Interfaces
always have fields as public static and final. Which means we cannot change them. We can only access them.
