File handling in java:
what are files
Files are mechanism that helps us store data permanently on our computer
qhy we should use file instead of putting the data with code.
Everytime when we need to make a change,
we don't need to redeploy and recompile the code
Steps involved in the compiling and deploying the code..
servers=> Computers that are up all the time, they are the same as our normal laptop/computer but with very good
hardware.
1) Developers develop code on development servers perform unit testing deploy this code to QA servers
2) Testers test the applications on the QA server
3) After QA is done they may deploy the code on performance, security testing servers
4) Deployment on Staging servers
5) Deployment on UAT servers
6) Deployment on production servers
To avoid all of these processes we create a configuration file and we store the configuration in the file
this configuration file may contain.
Usernames passwords URLs to databases other information for configuration
