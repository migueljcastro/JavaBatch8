Interfaces:
Its a mechanism to achieve abstraction in Java. We can achieve 100% abstraction and multiple inheritance using the
interfaces. We us interface when we know nothing about implementation and we only know about the functionality.
1)An interface have all of the fields as public static final by default and we can not create instance fields..WHY?
bc we can not create an object of Interface. If we try ti declare the fields as anything other than public static final
we will get an error. They are widely used to support lambdas in java.
2)An interface can have static methods, default method and abstract methods
3)Any class who implements the Interface has to provide the implementation for the abstract methods or we can declare
that class as abstract
