Final keyword:
final is a keyword in java that can be used with class field and methods.
if we have declared a class as final class then no other class can inherit our class.

final public class DemoClass{

int number;
demoClass(int number){
this.number=number
}
void printNumber(){
System.out.println(number);
}
}

public class ChildClass extends DemoClass{ CE error //cannot inherit from a final class

}

Benefits of final classes:
1) Privacy
2) A<-B<-C<-D.... if we have a long chain of classes which have a inheritance relationship and if we want to restrict
this chain we can use the final keyword. Why? Because we waste a lot of memory if we don't use these classes
properly
3) final keyword can be used with class, variable and with method.
4) restricts further modification
5) when using final keyword with an entity(class or variable or method) it gets the meaning that entity is
complete and can not be modified further
6) final is a non access modifier
7)
