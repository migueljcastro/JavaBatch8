Constructors:
1)It is a special block of code/similar to a method that is executed when we create an object
of a class
2) The purpose of constructors is to initialize our fields.
3) They must have the same name as the name of the class
4) Constructors do not have return types not even void
5) we can pass arguments to our constructors just like we do for our methods
similarities between constructors and methods
1)Both can have parameters
2)both can have access modifiers like private public and protected/default
Differences constructors and methods:
1) As we can use nay name for our method we can not use any name for our constructor
they must have the same name as of our class
2)Constructors can not return values as methods can
3) Constructors are automatically called when an instance of the class is created.
When should use constructors?
when we wan to control the initialization fo our fields.
